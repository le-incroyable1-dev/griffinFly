# griffinFly
griffinFly is a virtual flight simulator for young children (4-8 years). The aim of this project is to 
explore the navigational experiences of flying in a virtual environment via body 
gestures. This project aims to create a virtual flight simulation for children that allows 
them to engage with the virtual world using gestures and real-world objects using 
their devicesâ€™ webcam. It provides a fun learning experience, and some source of 
physical activity wherein young children can exercise and enjoy themselves in the 
comfort of their room.

The project also offers a simulation of various worlds and exciting and interactive 
powerups. Children can use their laptops, desktop, or tablet to run this application. 
There is no need for any other hardware equipment to experience the simulation. 
Real-world objects can be used by the children to enable power-ups and additional 
features inside the virtual world. The child can complete guided missions enabling a 
goal-oriented mindset.

Developed using Unity3D, Barracuda, OpenCV, and Tensorflow!
